Dynamic Programming: Optimal BSTs
==========

Final project for CSC172 ([Data Structures and Algorithms](http://cs.rochester.edu/u/brown/172/)) at the University of Rochester. Coded in the course of a few days for the final major grade of the semester. See the *assignment* folder for more information. The basics of this excercise, in easily-understandable english:

Idea
----------

Expand and understand two different types of algorithms to generate "Optimal BSTs" for specifically-given data. In this case, we're creating [Huffman Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)-like trees that are based off of a set of keys and associated probabilities. The higher the probability, the easier (computation/data structure-wise) it should be to retrieve.

The given trees that *must* be reproducable by the end of this assignment are the leftmost and rightmost pictures below (middle is the "balanced" option, not part of this project):
